# AngularPosts

Using Angular 2+ and any frameworks/open source libraries required, create an application that does the following: 

1. Periodically (every 10 seconds) poll for new posts from this API https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?tags=story via a GET request.
2. Display the title, url, created_at, and author of each post in a table.
3. Upon selecting a row in the table, a modal should appear containing the raw JSON data of post. This modal should support dismissal by clicking outside of the modal as well as upon clicking a close button.
4. Support the ability to filter/search the table by title.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
